# Azure AD for devs - a primer
Learn about Azure AD - Microsoft's cloud-scale identity platform. It can be tricky to figure out how auth works, but once you know it's a powerful tool in your toolbox. In this repository we'll learn how it's done in a .NET web app. We'll discover what app registrations are, why we need one and how to wire up auth between a web app and an API backend.

## Getting Started
Run the app and observe the CRUD operations for TodListClient a .NET 7 ASP.NET Core MVC web app with a Web API backend that uses an in-memory dataset.

1. Set multiple startup projects

1. Start the solution and view the TodoList page

    You are now ready to use the demo script to learn about Azure AD App Registrations and the code changes needed to bring auth to your soltuion.
